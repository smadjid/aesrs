# AESRS: Adaptive Exploration Space Recommender System


## Introduction

AESRS (Adaptive Exploration Space Recommender System) is a location-based recommendation system that leverages the principles of Knowledge Space Theory (KST) to define an 'Exploration Space'. The system is designed to recommend an optimal path of locations to users, maximizing their expected interest based on their preferences and behaviors.

## System Overview

AESRS consists of several key components:

- **Location**: Represents a location or point of interest in the city.
- **User**: Represents a user with their preferences and exploration state.
- **ExplorationSpace**: Represents the exploration space and includes methods for computing similarity between locations, basis functions, user preferences, surmise relations, probabilistic models, sequential patterns, user interests, collaborative filtering recommendations, and incorporating diversity and serendipity into the recommendations.

The system operates in several phases:

- **Basis Functions and Surmise Relations**: The system computes basis functions and surmise relations based on the principles of Knowledge Space Theory (KST). Basis functions map each item to a set of related items, reflecting the dependencies among exploration items. Surmise relations establish a partial order on the items, indicating the sequence in which exploration items should ideally be acquired.

- **User Modeling**: The system constructs and updates a profile for each user, which includes their current exploration state and preferences. User preferences are modeled based on both explicit inputs (e.g., ratings, favorites) and implicit behaviors (e.g., click-through rates, visit frequency).

- **Recommendation Algorithm**: The recommendation algorithm leverages the Exploration Space concept to generate personalized recommendations for users. It operates in several core phases: assessment, exploration space construction, and recommendation.

## Theoretical Foundations

AESRS is based on the principles of Knowledge Space Theory (KST), which provides a rigorous mathematical framework for modeling the acquisition and structure of knowledge. In the context of our location-based recommendation system, we adapt KST to define an 'Exploration Space'. Each location or point of interest in the city corresponds to an 'exploration item', and a user's exploration state (analogous to a knowledge state) represents the set of locations they have visited or are interested in.

The structure of an exploration space is defined using basis functions and surmise relations. Basis functions map each item to a set of related items, reflecting the dependencies among exploration items. Surmise relations establish a partial order on the items, indicating the sequence in which exploration items should ideally be acquired.

In addition to these theoretical foundations, AESRS incorporates several advanced techniques in recommender systems and geographic information systems, including probabilistic models, sequential pattern mining, and the incorporation of diversity and serendipity into the recommendations.
